# SDD (Spec-Driven Development)

You are executing the SDD process. Route to the appropriate command based on `$0`.

## Command Routing

- If `$0` is "init" → execute **INIT** with language `$1` (default: en)
- If `$0` is "analyze" → execute **ANALYZE** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "design" → execute **DESIGN** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "implement" → execute **IMPLEMENT** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "test" → execute **TEST** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "resume" → execute **RESUME** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "status" → execute **STATUS** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "review" → execute **REVIEW** with issue `$1`
- If `$0` is "rollback" → execute **ROLLBACK** with issue `$1` and target stage `$2`
- If `$0` is "help" or empty → execute **HELP**
- If `$0` is anything else → report unknown command and execute **HELP**

---

## INIT

Set up SDD for the current GitHub repository.

**Language argument:** `$1` determines the language for Issue templates.
- `ko`, `korean`, `한국어` → Korean
- `ja`, `japanese`, `日本語` → Japanese
- `en`, `english`, or empty → English (default)

1. Copy Issue templates from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/{lang}/issue_*.yml` to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
   - Select the template directory based on the language argument
2. Save the selected language to `.github/.sdd-lang` file for other commands to reference
3. Create GitHub labels:
   ```bash
   gh label create "sdd:analyze" --color "1d76db" --description "SDD: Requirements Analysis" --force
   gh label create "sdd:design" --color "0e8a16" --description "SDD: Design" --force
   gh label create "sdd:implement" --color "e4e669" --description "SDD: Implementation" --force
   gh label create "sdd:test" --color "f9d0c4" --description "SDD: Testing" --force
   gh label create "sdd:done" --color "0075ca" --description "SDD: Done" --force
   gh label create "sdd:child" --color "d4c5f9" --description "SDD: Child Issue" --force
   ```
4. Report completion with a summary of what was installed.

---

## ANALYZE

**Stage 1: Requirements Analysis (What / Why)**

Focus ONLY on What and Why. Do NOT discuss How (technical implementation).

### Process:
1. Read the Issue: `gh issue view $1`
   - If the Issue does not exist or is inaccessible → report error and stop
   - If the Issue body is empty or malformed → ask user to fill in the required fields
2. Check if this is a child Issue (body contains `Parent Issue: #<number>`):
   - If yes: read the parent Issue's analyze and design outputs for context
     ```bash
     gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<parent>/comments --jq '.[].body'
     ```
   - Use parent context to understand the broader scope, but focus analysis on this child's sub-feature only
3. Classify the request type (new feature / enhancement / bug fix / refactoring)
4. Analyze What (feature list) and Why (background, motivation)
5. If information is missing, ask the user (do NOT ask How questions)
6. Split into feature list with priorities
7. Read the language setting from `.github/.sdd-lang` (default: en)
8. Format output using the template in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/{lang}/output_analyze.md`

### Self-Review:
- Check for missing features, ambiguous descriptions
- Verify What/Why are sufficient
- If issues found, go back and improve

### User Review:
- Present the output to the user
- Ask for confirmation on direction and priorities
- On approval: post as Issue comment and update label to `sdd:design`

```bash
# Check if a previous analyze output exists (e.g. after rollback)
EXISTING_COMMENT_ID=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("sdd:analyze:output")) | .id' | tail -1)

if [ -n "$EXISTING_COMMENT_ID" ]; then
  # Update the existing comment instead of creating a duplicate
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$EXISTING_COMMENT_ID \
    -X PATCH --field body="<output content here>"
else
  # Post new output as Issue comment
  gh issue comment $1 --body "<output content here>"
fi

# Update label
gh issue edit $1 --remove-label "sdd:analyze" --add-label "sdd:design"
```

---

## DESIGN

**Stage 2: Design (How)**

Define HOW to implement based on the requirements.

### Process:
1. Read analyze output from Issue comments:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments --jq '.[].body' | grep -A 1000 'sdd:analyze:output' | grep -B 1000 '/sdd:analyze:output'
   ```
   - If no analyze output found → report error: "Run `/sdd analyze $1` first" and stop
2. Check if this is a child Issue (body contains `Parent Issue: #<number>`):
   - If yes: read the parent Issue's design output for context (architecture decisions, PR split rationale, constraints)
     ```bash
     gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<parent>/comments --jq '.[].body' | grep -A 1000 'sdd:design:output' | grep -B 1000 '/sdd:design:output'
     ```
   - The child's design must be consistent with the parent's overall architecture and design decisions
   - Focus on the detailed design for this child's sub-feature only
3. Explore the codebase — analyze existing architecture and patterns
4. Identify impact scope (related files, screens, data)
5. Design file structure changes
6. Design data model changes (if applicable)
7. Identify constraints and risks
8. Create feature list with PR split
8. Read the language setting from `.github/.sdd-lang` (default: en)
9. Format output using the template in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/{lang}/output_design.md`

### Self-Review:
- Verify design matches requirements
- Check for missing impact scope
- Assess feasibility

### User Review:
- Present the output to the user
- Ask for confirmation on technical approach and PR split
- On approval:
  - Check if a previous design output exists (e.g. after rollback):
    ```bash
    EXISTING_COMMENT_ID=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments \
      --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("sdd:design:output")) | .id' | tail -1)
    ```
    - If exists → update the existing comment instead of creating a duplicate
    - If not → post new output as Issue comment
  - If **single PR** → update label to `sdd:implement`
  - If **multiple PRs** → execute **Child Issue Creation** below, then update label to `sdd:implement`

### Child Issue Creation (when multiple PRs are needed):

When the design identifies 2 or more PRs, create a child Issue for each sub-feature:

1. Read the language setting from `.github/.sdd-lang` (default: en)
2. For each sub-feature in the design:
   - Format the child Issue body using the template in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/{lang}/output_child_issue.md`
   - Placeholders are NOT processed by a template engine. AI must manually replace them:
     - `{{parent_issue}}` → replace with `$1`
     - `{{sub_feature_description}}` → replace with the sub-feature description from design
     - `{{criteria_list}}` → replace with a markdown checkbox list from design (e.g. `- [ ] Criterion 1\n- [ ] Criterion 2`)
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "[SDD Child] <parent title> - <sub-feature name>" \
     --body "<formatted body from template>" --label "sdd:analyze" --label "sdd:child"
   ```
3. Post the child Issue list as a comment on the parent Issue using the template in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/{lang}/output_children.md`
   - Add a row for each created child Issue to the table
4. Post design output as Issue comment on parent Issue
5. Update parent Issue label to `sdd:implement`
6. Ask user which child Issue to start with, then execute **ANALYZE** on that child Issue

---

## IMPLEMENT

**Stage 3: Implementation - TDD Cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)**

### Determine Issue type:

1. Check if this Issue has child Issues:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments --jq '.[].body' | grep 'sdd:children:output'
   ```
2. **Parent Issue (has children)**: Do NOT implement directly. Instead:
   - List child Issues and their current status
   - Ask user which child Issue to work on
   - Execute **ANALYZE** or **RESUME** on the selected child Issue
3. **Single Issue or Child Issue (no children)**: Execute TDD cycle below

### TDD Cycle (single Issue or child Issue):

Test scope: Unit tests / UI tests (widget tests, golden tests, etc.)

#### 3-0. PR Kickoff: Plan
1. Read design output from Issue comments
2. Create feature branch:
   - Single Issue: `feat/<feature-name>`
   - Child Issue: `feat/<parent-feature>/<child-feature>` (e.g. `feat/user-profile/avatar-upload`)
3. Write test plan for this PR
4. Write implementation plan based on test plan
5. **Self-review**: verify test coverage and feasibility
6. **User review**: confirm plan direction before proceeding

#### 3-1. Red: Write Failing Tests
1. Write test code based on test plan
2. Run tests → confirm failure (Red)
3. **Self-review**: check test code quality
4. **User review**: confirm test code

#### 3-2. Green: Minimal Implementation
1. Implement minimal code to pass tests
2. Run tests → confirm pass (Green)
3. **Self-review**: ensure no unnecessary code
4. **User review**: confirm implementation direction

#### 3-3. Refactor: Improve Code
1. Remove duplication, improve readability, clean up structure
2. Run tests → confirm still passing (Green)
3. **Self-review**: check code quality and pattern consistency
4. **User review**: confirm refactoring result

#### 3-4. PR Creation & Code Review
1. Summarize changes
2. Create PR:
   - Single Issue: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #$1\n\n..."`
   - Child Issue: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #$1\nParent Issue: #<parent>\n\n..."`
3. Re-run all tests → confirm pass
4. **Self-review**: check code consistency, verify no missing features
5. **User review**: final confirmation
6. Update label to `sdd:test`

### After child Issue reaches `sdd:done`:

If this Issue is a child Issue (Issue body contains `Parent Issue: #<number>`):

1. Find parent Issue number from the `<!-- sdd:child-issue -->` block in Issue body:
   ```bash
   gh issue view $1 --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oP 'Parent Issue: #\K[0-9]+'
   ```
2. Find the children comment on parent Issue using `gh api` with `--jq` to get the **exact comment** with both start and end markers:
   ```bash
   # Use jq to find the single comment containing both markers — avoids false matches
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<parent>/comments \
     --jq '.[] | select((.body | contains("<!-- sdd:children:output -->")) and (.body | contains("<!-- /sdd:children:output -->"))) | {id, body}'
   ```
   - If no matching comment found → warn user and skip update
   - If multiple comments match → use the **most recent one** (last in the array)
3. Update the children comment — replace this child's status label in the table row:
   ```bash
   COMMENT_ID=<id from step 2>
   # Read the comment body, replace the status for this child Issue's row, then update
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID \
     -X PATCH --field body="<updated body with new status>"
   ```
4. Verify the update was applied by re-reading the comment
5. Check if ALL child Issues are now `sdd:done`:
   - Read each child Issue's labels directly (do NOT rely only on the comment table):
     ```bash
     gh issue view <child-number> --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
     ```
   - If all `sdd:done` → add a comment to the parent Issue notifying all children are complete, and suggest running `/sdd test <parent>` or `/sdd resume <parent>`
   - If not → report remaining children to the user and ask which child to work on next

---

## TEST

**Stage 4: Testing**

Unit/UI tests are already done in Stage 3. This stage focuses on E2E and QA.

### Determine Issue type:

1. **Parent Issue (has children)**: Check all child Issues
   - Read child Issue numbers from the children comment
   - Check each child Issue's label:
     ```bash
     gh issue view <child-number> --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
     ```
   - If any child Issue is NOT `sdd:done` → report which children are incomplete, ask user to complete them first
   - If ALL child Issues are `sdd:done` → proceed with parent-level E2E/QA below
2. **Single Issue or Child Issue**: proceed with E2E/QA below

### 4-0. Test Setup:
1. Explore the codebase to detect the project's existing test setup:
   - Test framework (e.g. Jest, Pytest, Go test, Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
   - Test directory structure (e.g. `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `e2e/`, etc.)
   - Test run command (e.g. `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, etc.)
   - Test configuration files (e.g. `jest.config.js`, `playwright.config.ts`, etc.)
2. If no existing E2E test setup is found:
   - Recommend a framework based on the project's tech stack
   - Ask user for confirmation before setting up
3. Report detected test setup to user

### 4-1. E2E Test (AI writes and runs):
1. Read analyze/design outputs from Issue comments
2. If parent Issue: read all child Issues' implementation PRs to understand what was built
3. If single/child Issue: read implementation PR
4. Write E2E test code using the detected framework, following existing test patterns and directory structure
5. Start test environment → run E2E tests → check results
6. **Self-review**: analyze test logs, verify coverage, estimate bug causes
   - If E2E tests fail → fix test code or identify bugs
   - If bugs found → go back to Stage 3 for TDD bug fix cycle
7. **User review**: confirm E2E test code and results

### 4-2. QA Checklist (AI creates, AI + User review):
1. Create QA checklist based on requirements
2. Identify regression test targets
3. **Self-review**: check for missing test scenarios, edge cases, and regression risks
4. **User review**: confirm QA checklist is complete and correct
   - User may add/remove/modify checklist items

### 4-3. Manual QA (User executes):
1. User performs manual QA testing based on the approved checklist
2. User runs regression tests
3. User reports results (pass/fail per checklist item)

### 4-4. Results Review:
1. If any QA item fails → analyze cause, go back to Stage 3 for TDD bug fix cycle
2. All tests pass → update label to `sdd:done`

```bash
gh issue edit $1 --remove-label "sdd:test" --add-label "sdd:done"
```

---

## RESUME

**Resume work on an Issue from where it left off.**

Automatically detect the current stage and continue the process.

### Process:
1. Read Issue labels to determine current stage:
   ```bash
   gh issue view $1 --json labels,title --jq '{title: .title, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
   ```
2. Check Issue comments for existing stage outputs:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments --jq '.[].body'
   ```
   - Check for `<!-- sdd:analyze:output -->` marker
   - Check for `<!-- sdd:design:output -->` marker
   - Check for `<!-- sdd:children:output -->` marker (parent Issue with children)
3. Check related PRs and their status:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --search "issue:$1" --json number,title,state
   ```

### If Parent Issue (has `<!-- sdd:children:output -->` marker):
1. Read child Issue numbers from the children comment
2. Check each child Issue's current label:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <child-number> --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
   ```
3. Report overall progress:
   ```
   Issue #$1: <title> (Parent)
   Child Issues:
   - #124: <name> → sdd:done ✓
   - #125: <name> → sdd:implement (in progress)
   - #126: <name> → sdd:analyze (not started)
   ```
4. Determine action:
   - If all children `sdd:done`:
     - Update parent label: `gh issue edit $1 --remove-label "sdd:implement" --add-label "sdd:test"`
     - Execute **TEST** on parent
   - If any child is incomplete → ask user which child to resume, then execute **RESUME** on that child

### If Single Issue or Child Issue:

Determine resume point based on findings:

   | Label | Output exists? | Action |
   |-------|---------------|--------|
   | `sdd:analyze` | No analyze output | Execute **ANALYZE** |
   | `sdd:design` | Analyze output exists, no design output | Execute **DESIGN** |
   | `sdd:implement` | Design output exists | Execute **IMPLEMENT** |
   | `sdd:test` | Implementation PRs merged | Execute **TEST** |
   | `sdd:done` | All complete | Report: Issue is already complete |
   | No SDD label | — | Add `sdd:analyze` label and execute **ANALYZE** |

For `sdd:implement` stage, further check sub-step:
   - If no open PRs and no merged PRs → start PR (3-0)
   - If open PR exists → check branch, read PR diff, and continue TDD cycle
   - If PR was closed (not merged) → warn user, ask whether to reopen or start a new PR
   - If branch exists but no PR → ask user whether to create PR from existing branch or start fresh
   - If PR exists but branch was deleted → start a new branch and PR (3-0)

Report current status to user before continuing:
   ```
   Issue #$1: <title>
   Current stage: <stage>
   Resuming from: <specific point>
   ```
Ask user for confirmation, then execute the appropriate stage command

---

## STATUS

Check the current progress of an Issue.

1. Read Issue labels: `gh issue view $1 --json labels`
2. Check Issue comments for each stage output:
   - `<!-- sdd:analyze:output -->` exists?
   - `<!-- sdd:design:output -->` exists?
   - `<!-- sdd:children:output -->` exists? (parent Issue)
3. Check related PRs: `gh pr list --search "issue:$1"`
4. If parent Issue, check all child Issue statuses
5. Summarize current stage and progress

Output format (single Issue):
```
Issue #$1: <title>
Stage: <current stage based on label>
- [x] Analyze: completed
- [x] Design: completed
- [ ] Implement: in progress
- [ ] Test: not started
```

Output format (parent Issue):
```
Issue #$1: <title> (Parent)
Stage: implement
- [x] Analyze: completed
- [x] Design: completed (3 child Issues created)
- [ ] Implement:
  - #124: <name> → sdd:done ✓
  - #125: <name> → sdd:implement
  - #126: <name> → sdd:analyze
- [ ] Test: not started
```

---

## REVIEW

Review the current stage output of an Issue.

### Determine Issue type:

1. Check if this is a parent Issue (has `<!-- sdd:children:output -->` marker in comments)
2. If **parent Issue** → execute **Parent Review** below
3. If **single Issue or child Issue** → execute **Standard Review** below

### Standard Review (single Issue or child Issue):

1. Determine current stage from Issue labels
2. Read the latest output from Issue comments
3. Perform AI review based on stage:
   - **analyze**: missing features, ambiguous descriptions, What/Why sufficient?
   - **design**: design matches requirements? missing impact scope? feasible?
   - **implement**: code quality, pattern consistency, test coverage?
   - **test**: test coverage, regression risks?
4. If child Issue: also check consistency with parent Issue's design
   ```bash
   gh issue view $1 --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oP 'Parent Issue: #\K[0-9]+'
   ```
   - Read parent's design output and verify child's work aligns with overall architecture
5. Post review result as Issue comment

### Parent Review:

1. Read child Issue numbers from the children comment
2. For each child Issue, check:
   - Current stage (label)
   - Latest output quality (read comments)
   - If in `implement` stage: check PR status and code quality
3. Generate a summary review:
   ```
   ## SDD Parent Review: #$1

   ### Overall Progress
   - Completed: N / Total child Issues
   - In progress: #<numbers>
   - Not started: #<numbers>

   ### Per-child Review
   - #124: <status> — <brief assessment>
   - #125: <status> — <brief assessment>

   ### Cross-cutting Concerns
   - <consistency issues between child implementations>
   - <shared dependency conflicts>
   - <integration risks>
   ```
4. Post review result as Issue comment on parent Issue

---

## ROLLBACK

**Roll back an Issue to a previous stage.**

Usage: `/sdd rollback <issue> <target-stage>`

Target stages: `analyze`, `design`, `implement`

### Process:
1. Read current Issue labels and stage:
   ```bash
   gh issue view $1 --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
   ```
2. Validate rollback direction:
   - Can only roll back to an **earlier** stage (e.g. `design` → `analyze`, `implement` → `design`)
   - Cannot roll back to `test` or `done`
   - If already at or before the target stage → report and do nothing
3. Confirm with user before proceeding:
   ```
   Rolling back Issue #$1 from <current stage> to <target stage>.
   This will:
   - Change label from <current> to <target>
   - Previous stage outputs in Issue comments will be preserved for reference
   ```
4. On user confirmation, update labels:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit $1 --remove-label "<current label>" --add-label "sdd:<target>"
   ```
5. Post a rollback notice as Issue comment:
   ```markdown
   <!-- sdd:rollback -->
   **Rolled back** from `<current stage>` to `<target stage>`.
   Reason: <user's reason or "requested by user">
   <!-- /sdd:rollback -->
   ```
6. Execute the target stage command (e.g. **ANALYZE** or **DESIGN**)

### Parent Issue rollback:
- Rolling back a parent Issue to `design` does NOT delete child Issues
- Child Issues remain as-is; the user can close them manually if the design changes significantly
- Warn the user: "Existing child Issues (#124, #125, ...) were created from the previous design. Review and close them if the new design changes scope."

### Child Issue rollback:
- Same as single Issue rollback
- If rolling back to `analyze`, warn that the new analysis/design should remain consistent with the parent's design
