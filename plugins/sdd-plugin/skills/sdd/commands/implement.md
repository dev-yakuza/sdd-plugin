# IMPLEMENT

**Stage 3: Implementation - TDD Cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)**

## Determine Issue type:

1. Check if this Issue has child Issues:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$1/comments --jq '.[].body' | grep 'sdd:children:output'
   ```
2. **Parent Issue (has children)**: Do NOT implement directly. Instead:
   - List child Issues and their current status
   - Ask user which child Issue to work on
   - Execute **ANALYZE** or **RESUME** on the selected child Issue
3. **Single Issue or Child Issue (no children)**: Execute TDD cycle below

## TDD Cycle (single Issue or child Issue):

Test scope: Unit tests / UI tests (widget tests, golden tests, etc.)

### 3-0. PR Kickoff: Plan
1. Read design output from Issue comments
2. Create feature branch:
   - Single Issue: `feat/<feature-name>`
   - Child Issue: `feat/<parent-feature>/<child-feature>` (e.g. `feat/user-profile/avatar-upload`)
3. Write test plan for this PR
4. Write implementation plan based on test plan
5. **Self-review**: verify test coverage and feasibility
6. **User review**: confirm plan direction before proceeding

### 3-1. Red: Write Failing Tests
1. Write test code based on test plan
2. Run tests → confirm failure (Red)
3. **Self-review**: check test code quality
4. **User review**: confirm test code

### 3-2. Green: Minimal Implementation
1. Implement minimal code to pass tests
2. Run tests → confirm pass (Green)
3. **Self-review**: ensure no unnecessary code
4. **User review**: confirm implementation direction

### 3-3. Refactor: Improve Code
1. Remove duplication, improve readability, clean up structure
2. Run tests → confirm still passing (Green)
3. **Self-review**: check code quality and pattern consistency
4. **User review**: confirm refactoring result

### 3-4. PR Creation & Code Review
1. Summarize changes
2. Create PR:
   - Single Issue: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #$1\n\n..."`
   - Child Issue: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #$1\nParent Issue: #<parent>\n\n..."`
3. Re-run all tests → confirm pass
4. **Review Loop**: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/commands/ai-review.md` and execute with the implementation changes (stage: **implement**)
5. **User review**: present review loop results (rounds, issues fixed, verdict), final confirmation
6. Update label to `sdd:test`

## After child Issue reaches `sdd:done`:

If this Issue is a child Issue (Issue body contains `Parent Issue: #<number>`):

1. Find parent Issue number from the `<!-- sdd:child-issue -->` block in Issue body
2. Find the children comment on parent Issue using `gh api` with `--jq` to get the **exact comment** with both start and end markers:
   ```bash
   # Use jq to find the single comment containing both markers — avoids false matches
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<parent>/comments \
     --jq '.[] | select((.body | contains("<!-- sdd:children:output -->")) and (.body | contains("<!-- /sdd:children:output -->"))) | {id, body}'
   ```
   - If no matching comment found → warn user and skip update
   - If multiple comments match → use the **most recent one** (last in the array)
3. Update the children comment — replace this child's status label in the table row:
   ```bash
   COMMENT_ID=<id from step 2>
   # Read the comment body, replace the status for this child Issue's row, then update
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID \
     -X PATCH --field body="<updated body with new status>"
   ```
4. Verify the update was applied by re-reading the comment
5. Check if ALL child Issues are now `sdd:done`:
   - Read each child Issue's labels directly (do NOT rely only on the comment table)
   - If all `sdd:done` → add a comment to the parent Issue notifying all children are complete, and suggest running `/sdd test <parent>` or `/sdd resume <parent>`
   - If not → report remaining children to the user and ask which child to work on next
