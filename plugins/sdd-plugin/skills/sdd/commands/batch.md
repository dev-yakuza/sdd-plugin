# BATCH

**Batch process multiple Issues through the SDD pipeline in separate sessions.**

Each Issue runs in an independent `claude -p` session with skip-review enabled (analyze through PR creation), minimizing token consumption. Human reviews PRs and runs QA after batch completes.

> ⚠️ **Security note**: The generated batch script invokes each child session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This bypasses **all** permission prompts and sandbox boundaries in the child session, so test runners (e.g. `flutter test`), commit hooks, and `git push` / `gh pr create` can execute unattended. Use `/sdd batch` only when you accept that the child sessions may run any tool without prompting. All tool calls are recorded in `.github/.sdd-batch-logs/<issue>-<timestamp>.log` for audit.

## Recommended: run in a git worktree

Because the child sessions execute with elevated permissions and may switch branches, stash, or run pre-commit hooks, **strongly consider running `/sdd batch` from a dedicated git worktree** rather than your main checkout. A separate worktree gives the batch its own working tree, index, HEAD, and stash stack, so any mishaps (mis-stashed config, dirty working tree carried across Issues, accidental file deletion) stay isolated and recoverable by simply removing the worktree.

```bash
# From your main checkout (assumed at .../<repo>):
git worktree add ../<repo>-batch main      # or any base branch
cd ../<repo>-batch
# ... run /sdd batch from here ...
# When the batch is finished and PRs are reviewed:
cd ../<repo>
git worktree remove ../<repo>-batch
```

Branches created by the batch are still pushed to the same remote (so PRs work normally), but the local repository state is isolated. If a batch goes wrong, the recovery is `git worktree remove --force ../<repo>-batch` — your main checkout is untouched. Before running the script, the batch flow should detect whether the current directory is a worktree and **suggest creating one if it is not**:

```bash
# Detection (during Phase 1 confirmation):
if [ "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" = "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" ]; then
  # Not in a worktree — same dir is the main repo
  echo "[batch] You are about to run in the main checkout. Consider:"
  echo "  git worktree add ../<repo>-batch <base-branch>"
  echo "  cd ../<repo>-batch"
fi
```

This is a recommendation, not a hard requirement; the user can decline and proceed in the main checkout.

## Argument Parsing:

Parse `$1`:
- Empty or not provided → **All open Issues** mode
- Comma-separated numbers (e.g. `1,2,3`) → **Specific Issues** mode

## Phase 1: Collect and Filter Issues

### All open Issues mode:
1. Fetch all open Issues:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 200
   ```

### Specific Issues mode:
1. For each Issue number in the comma-separated list, fetch its details:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --json number,title,labels,state
   ```
2. Validate each Issue exists and is open. If any Issue is closed or missing → warn and exclude it.

### Filter:

**All open Issues mode**:
1. **Exclude** Issues with `sdd:done` label (already completed)
2. **Exclude** Issues with `sdd:child` label (will be auto-discovered after the parent runs)
3. **Include** all remaining Issues (with or without SDD labels)
4. Sort by Issue number ascending

**Specific Issues mode** (user explicitly listed numbers):
1. **Exclude** Issues with `sdd:done` label (warn the user that the listed Issue is already done)
2. **Include** Issues with `sdd:child` label (the user explicitly chose them; respect intent)
3. **Include** all remaining Issues
4. Sort by Issue number ascending

If no Issues remain after filtering → report "No qualifying Issues found." and stop.

> Note: regardless of mode, the batch script will **auto-discover child Issues** that are created during a parent's processing (via `<!-- sdd:children:output -->` marker / `Parent Issue: #<n>` reference) and append them to the queue.

### Confirm with user:
Show the filtered Issue list with current stage:
```
SDD Batch Processing
════════════════════
Issues to process (in order):

  #10: Add user authentication       [new]
  #11: Fix pagination bug             [sdd:design]
  #12: Refactor logging module        [sdd:implement]

Total: 3 issues (queue may grow as parent Issues spawn children)
Mode: Sequential (each in a separate claude -p session)
Skip-review: analyze, design, implement, pr (auto-enabled — stops after PR creation)
Child auto-queue: enabled (children created by a parent are appended to the queue)
```

Determine stage label for display:
- No SDD label → `[new]`
- Has SDD label → show the label (e.g. `[sdd:analyze]`)

**Workspace check** — before asking for confirmation, detect whether the current directory is a dedicated git worktree:

```bash
COMMON_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null)
```

If `COMMON_DIR` equals `GIT_DIR` (or both resolve to the same absolute path), the user is in the **main checkout**, not a worktree. In that case, append the following warning to the confirmation summary:

```
⚠ Workspace: main checkout detected (not a worktree).
  Recommended: run this batch from a worktree to isolate the working tree.

      git worktree add ../<repo>-batch <base-branch>
      cd ../<repo>-batch

  Proceed in the main checkout anyway? [y/N]
```

If the user answers no, stop without generating the script. If yes, continue. Otherwise (already in a worktree) skip the warning and ask the standard confirmation.

## Phase 2: Verify Tool Permissions

`claude -p` sessions need tool permissions pre-configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

> Note: The generated script also passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to each child `claude -p`, which bypasses prompts and sandbox boundaries at runtime. The permissions registered here are still useful as a documented allowlist (and as a fallback if the user removes the flag), but they are **not strictly required** for the script to run unattended once the flag is in place. Treat the items below as the recommended baseline.

1. Read `.claude/settings.local.json` if it exists.
2. Check which permissions from the groups below are already present.
3. **Detect project type** by inspecting the repository root (use Read/Glob; do not require shelling out). For each marker present, pre-select the matching test-runner permission as `✓`. Markers can stack (e.g. a Flutter repo using FVM gets all three: `flutter`, `fvm`, `dart`).

   | Marker file/dir (in repo root) | Pre-select |
   |---|---|
   | `pubspec.yaml` | `Bash(flutter:*)`, `Bash(dart:*)` |
   | `.fvm/` or `.fvmrc` | `Bash(fvm:*)` |
   | `package.json` | `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(npx:*)` |
   | `yarn.lock` | `Bash(yarn:*)` |
   | `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `Bash(pnpm:*)` |
   | `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, or `Pipfile` | `Bash(pytest:*)` |
   | `go.mod` | `Bash(go:*)` |
   | `Cargo.toml` | `Bash(cargo:*)` |
   | `Makefile` | `Bash(make:*)` |

4. Show the permission selection UI with three groups (mark detected runners as `✓`, undetected as `◻`):

```
Tool permissions for batch mode (claude -p sessions)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Detected: <list each detected marker, e.g. "Flutter (pubspec.yaml), FVM (.fvm/)">

[Required] — SDD pipeline will fail without these
  ✓ Read           — Read files (source code, config, plugin cache)
  ✓ Edit           — Modify existing files
  ✓ Write          — Create new files
  ✓ Bash(gh:*)     — GitHub CLI (Issue, PR, label operations)
  ✓ Bash(git:*)    — Git (branch, commit, push — covers `git commit`)

[Recommended] — Needed for full pipeline functionality
  ✓ Grep           — Search code content
  ✓ Glob           — Search files by pattern
  ✓ Agent          — Subagent spawning (AI review, code exploration)
  ◻ WebSearch      — Web search (for research during analysis)

[Test Runners] — Auto-pre-selected based on detected markers; toggle as needed
  <state> Bash(flutter:*) — Flutter (build, test, analyze, pub)  [marker: pubspec.yaml]
  <state> Bash(dart:*)    — Dart CLI                              [marker: pubspec.yaml]
  <state> Bash(fvm:*)     — Flutter Version Manager               [marker: .fvm/ or .fvmrc]
  <state> Bash(npm:*)     — npm test, npm run                     [marker: package.json]
  <state> Bash(npx:*)     — npx jest, npx playwright              [marker: package.json]
  <state> Bash(yarn:*)    — yarn test, yarn run                   [marker: yarn.lock]
  <state> Bash(pnpm:*)    — pnpm test, pnpm run                   [marker: pnpm-lock.yaml]
  <state> Bash(pytest:*)  — Python pytest                         [marker: pyproject.toml/...]
  <state> Bash(go:*)      — go test                               [marker: go.mod]
  <state> Bash(cargo:*)   — cargo test (Rust)                     [marker: Cargo.toml]
  <state> Bash(make:*)    — make test, make build                 [marker: Makefile]
  ◻ Bash                  — All shell commands (overrides all above; not auto-selected)
```

(Replace each `<state>` with `✓` if pre-selected by detection or already in settings, otherwise `◻`.)

Display rules:
- `✓` = selected by default, `◻` = not selected by default
- **Exact match only**: a scoped permission (e.g. `Edit(/path/**)`) does NOT satisfy an unscoped requirement (e.g. `Edit`). Only an exact unscoped `Edit` entry counts as "already set" for the `Edit` requirement. If only a scoped variant exists, the unscoped permission must still be added.
- Permissions already in `settings.local.json` (exact match) → show as `✓ (already set)` and skip
- If `Bash` (unscoped) is already set → skip all `Bash(...)` entries and show `Bash ✓ (already set)`
- If a more-specific permission is already present (e.g. `Bash(flutter test:*)` exists but `Bash(flutter:*)` does not), still propose adding the broader `Bash(flutter:*)` so subagents can run the full toolchain (analyze, pub, build, etc.) needed by pre-commit hooks.

5. Ask user which items to change:
   ```
   Enter items to toggle (e.g. "WebSearch, Bash(npm:*)")
   or press Enter to continue with current selection:
   ```

6. On confirmation: create or merge into `.claude/settings.local.json` preserving existing entries
7. On "none" or rejection: warn that batch script may fail without permissions, but continue with script generation

## Phase 3: Generate Batch Script

Generate the file `.github/.sdd-batch.sh` with the following template. Replace `<ISSUE_NUMBERS>` with the actual space-separated Issue numbers from Phase 1.

```bash

After writing the script:
1. Make it executable: `chmod +x .github/.sdd-batch.sh`
2. Check if `.gitignore` exists and whether `.github/.sdd-batch-logs/` is listed
   - If not listed → suggest adding it (ask user)
3. Execute the script in background using the **Bash tool** with `run_in_background: true`:
   ```bash
   bash .github/.sdd-batch.sh
   ```
4. Report to user:
   ```
   SDD Batch started (running in background)

     Issues: <N>
     Logs: .github/.sdd-batch-logs/

   The batch script will:
     1. Process each issue sequentially via claude -p
     2. Restore your original config when done (even on Ctrl+C)
     3. Delete itself after completion

   You will be notified when the batch finishes.

   Monitor real-time progress (in another terminal):
     tail -f .github/.sdd-batch-logs/issue-<N>-*.log | \
       jq -r 'if .type == "assistant" then
         (.message.content[] |
           if .type == "tool_use" then "🔧 \(.name): \(.input.command // .input.file_path // .input.pattern // "")"
           elif .type == "text" then "💬 \(.text[0:120])"
           else empty end)
       elif .type == "result" then "✅ Done (\(.duration_ms/1000)s, $\(.total_cost_usd))"
       else empty end' 2>/dev/null
   ```
5. When the background execution completes, read the log files and report results:
   ```
   SDD Batch Complete
   ══════════════════
     #10: ✓ completed
     #11: ✓ completed
     #12: ✗ failed (see .github/.sdd-batch-logs/issue-12-*.log)

   Succeeded: 2/3
   ```
