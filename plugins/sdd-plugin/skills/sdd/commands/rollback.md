# ROLLBACK

**Roll back an Issue to a previous stage.**

Usage: `/sdd rollback <issue> <target-stage>`

Target stages: `analyze`, `design`, `implement`

## Process:
1. Read current Issue labels and stage:
   ```bash
   gh issue view $1 --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
   ```
2. Validate rollback direction:
   - Can only roll back to an **earlier** stage (e.g. `design` → `analyze`, `implement` → `design`)
   - Cannot roll back to `test` or `done`
   - If already at or before the target stage → report and do nothing
3. Confirm with user before proceeding:
   ```
   Rolling back Issue #$1 from <current stage> to <target stage>.
   This will:
   - Change label from <current> to <target>
   - Previous stage outputs in Issue comments will be preserved for reference
   ```
4. On user confirmation, update labels:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit $1 --remove-label "<current label>" --add-label "sdd:<target>"
   ```
5. Post a rollback notice as Issue comment:
   ```markdown
   <!-- sdd:rollback -->
   **Rolled back** from `<current stage>` to `<target stage>`.
   Reason: <user's reason or "requested by user">
   <!-- /sdd:rollback -->
   ```
6. Execute the target stage command (read the appropriate file from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/commands/`)

## Parent Issue rollback:
- Rolling back a parent Issue to `design` does NOT delete child Issues
- Child Issues remain as-is; the user can close them manually if the design changes significantly
- Warn the user: "Existing child Issues (#124, #125, ...) were created from the previous design. Review and close them if the new design changes scope."

## Child Issue rollback:
- Same as single Issue rollback
- If rolling back to `analyze`, warn that the new analysis/design should remain consistent with the parent's design
